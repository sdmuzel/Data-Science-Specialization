## Synopsis

The course project is a two part peer-graded assignment:

- Create a Shiny application and deploy it on RStudio's servers

- Use Slidify or RStudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation
about your application.

The name of the Shiny application developed for this project is the
**Motor Trend Data Analysis Application** and is hosted on RStudio's
shinyapps.io hosted service:

## Motor Trend Data Analysis Application

**Motor Trend Data Analysis** is an interactive Shiny application that uses
linear regression modeling techniques to estimate fuel consumption (MPG) in 32
automobiles (1973-74 models) based on 11 aspects of automobile design and
performance.
