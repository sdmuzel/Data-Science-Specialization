# November 02, 2020


The page was built in RStudio using R Markdown and the Leaflet package to
build an interactive map of my hometown.
```{r}

m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=-48.876050, lat=-23.981730, popup="The birthplace of R")
m  # Print the map
```
